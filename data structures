Tasks:
Write a program that accepts user input to create a list of integers. Then, compute the sum of all the integers in the list.

         QUESTION 1
# Get user input and split into individual strings
user_input = input("Enter integers separated by spaces: ")

# Convert strings to integers and create a list
numbers = [int(num) for num in user_input.split()]

# Calculate the sum
total = sum(numbers)

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of the integers is: {total}")

Create a tuple containing the names of five of your favorite books. Then, use a for loop to print each book name on a separate line.
          QUESTION 2
# Create a tuple of favorite books
favorite_books = (
    "The Alchemist",
    "Atomic Habits",
    "1984",
    "Sapiens",
    "The Great Gatsby"
)

# Print each book name using a for loop
print("My Favorite Books:")
for book in favorite_books:
    print(book)

 QUESTION 3
Write a program that uses a dictionary to store information about a person, such as their name, age, and favorite color. Ask the user for input and store the information in the dictionary. Then, print the dictionary to the console.
# Create an empty dictionary to store person's information
person = {}

# Get input from user
person['name'] = input("Enter your name: ")
person['age'] = int(input("Enter your age: "))
person['favorite_color'] = input("Enter your favorite color: ")

# Display the collected information
print("\nPersonal Information:")
print(person)

QUESTION 4
Write a program that accepts user input to create two sets of integers. Then, create a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.

# Get first set of integers
set1_input = input("Enter integers for the first set (separated by spaces): ")
set1 = set(map(int, set1_input.split()))

# Get second set of integers
set2_input = input("Enter integers for the second set (separated by spaces): ")
set2 = set(map(int, set2_input.split()))

# Find common elements using set intersection
common_elements = set1 & set2  # or set1.intersection(set2)

# Display results
print("\nFirst set:", set1)
print("Second set:", set2)
print("Common elements:", common_elements or "No common elementsÂ found")

QUESTION 5
Create a program that stores a list of words. Then, use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the words that have an odd number of characters.

# Get words from user input
user_input = input("Enter words separated by commas: ")
words = [word.strip() for word in user_input.split(",")]

# Filter odd-length words
odd_length_words = [word for word in words if len(word) % 2 == 1]

print("\nWords with odd character count:", odd_length_words)
